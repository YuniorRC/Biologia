The Tao that can be spoken
is not the eternal Tao
The name that can be named
is not the eternal name
The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth
The named is the mother of myriad things

Thus, constantly free of desire
One observes its wonders
Constantly filled with desire

Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working
Software is like that
